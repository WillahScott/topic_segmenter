Problem We’re Solving:
Slack contains a lot of information, some of it is known, using keyword filters or the search function. In other cases, it’s useful information that you didn’t previously know you were interested in. If you have been away from your channel for a while, uncovering this information can be time consuming or impossible. This leads the problem of ‘Slack Anxiety’ or the feeling of anxiousness you get when you haven’t been regularly checking in on your slack channels. Our tool proposes to make the experience of Filtering and Highlighting information while you were away more user friendly. The goal of the project is to group information into conversations with topics. This feature is both useful for channels you are very active in -‘getting up to date’ - as well as popping in to channels you infrequently use, getting a summary of ‘what’s been going on lately’.

will.monge [12:30 PM]
By the way, I have fleshed out the following summary, but feel free to comment/edit:
> The tool we are setting out to create will help navigate through the vast amount of activity that occurs through Slack by **clustering and summarizing conversations** so that users can easily get up to speed of all the topics that have been discussed and only review the messages of those he is interested in.

carlos [3:56 PM]
Nice!

[3:56]
@will.monge I took a stab at refining the thesis, do you want to go over it/add the above? In the google doc (edited)

will.monge [3:57 PM]

Bros, we got a starter slide deck for Week 6 presentation (10/4). You can find the slide deck here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FMcSVJ1IJbl5A6SCHy8SNPj8VHfVux4WhDHSUepClmw/edit?usp=sharing
The slide deck is in the shared drive in the folder called “Class Deliverables”. I created a quick template that I thought look decent. Feel free to update. It should get us started.

Please review the outline and add topics that are missing and bring up topics that might be unnecessary. In the notes section of each slide, I included the questions that I thought we should answer. If everyone’s on board with this outline, then we can start assigning slides. Here’s a quick outline of what I have so far:

Slide 1: *Title page* `we may want to consider a better title`
Slide 2: *The Problem* (What’s the problem we’re trying to solve? What is it that we’re doing? We should highlight IMPACT on this slide!)
Slide 3: *Our Unique Solution* (What’s our solution and why is it unique? How is it different than the existing solutions? We should highlight FEASIBILITY here.)
Slide 4: *Ethical Considerations* (What ethical considerations are we considering? This is especially important as we are not using a public data set.)
Slide 5: *Team Breakdown - Desirables* (How are we tackling the meat of the project?)
Slide 6: *Team Breakdown - Undesirables* (How are we tackling the parts of the project that no one wants to do?)
Slide 7: *Architecture Progress* (ASSIGNED: Kevin, Carlos, Alex; What progress have we made along the architecture front? Things to put here: quick diagram of potential architecture, quick discussion of technologies explored, next steps)
Slide 8: *NLP Progress* (ASSIGNED: Will, Walter)
Slide 9: *Questions*

**Time goals:**
Updates to the outline by noon on Monday, 9/26
Assignments to team members by end of day, Tuesday, 9/27


----- September 26th -----
carlos [7:28 PM]
@alex  in slide 2, I think we should emphasize the *why* of us tackling the problem (edited)

[7:30]
on slide 4, are we sure that we cannot get access to _any_ public slack team to work on/with?


----- September 28th -----
alex [4:34 AM]
Sorry for the delay. I’m pushing assignments to slides now.
@carlos, I like your point about the why for slide 2. I added that notes in the slide deck. considering public slack teams, I haven’t been able to find any. I found a bunch online (http://www.slacklist.info/) where it looks like your invitation to the team is basically guaranteed. However, the fact that you still an invitation feels like a non-public data set.

Here’s a potential breakdown of breakdown of speaking responsibilities/filling in Slide responsibilities.
Slide 1: *Title page* `none`
Slide 2: *The Problem* `Alex`
Slide 3: *Our Unique Solution* `Will`
Slide 4: *Ethical Considerations* `Will`
Slide 5: *Team Breakdown - Desirables* `Carlos`
Slide 6: *Team Breakdown - Undesirables* `Carlos`
Slide 7: *Architecture Progress* `Kevin`
Slide 8: *NLP Progress* `Walter`
Slide 9: *Questions* `everyone`

Does anybody disagree with these assignments? How does a *due date of noon, Eastern time* sound to everyone?

@kjydavis3 (Mr. Meetings), could we schedule 15 minutes in our next meeting (hopefully over the weekend) to run through the slides? I’m thinking that a quick practice run before Wednesday’s class would be useful. (edited)

Also, I was skimming through the Slack privacy policy. Their first principle is:

_The most fundamental privacy principle we follow is that by default, anything you post to Slack is private to your team. That is, viewing the messages and files shared within a specific team requires authentication as a member of that team._

If we take the Slack data out of Slack and folks outside of a team can see the data, then we run the risk of violating Slack’s “most fundamental privacy principle.” I was thinking of ways around this. For example, could we use Slackbots to keep the conversations and topic summaries viewable only in the appropriate Slack team? @will.monge, I know you’ve been thinking about this as well. Perhaps you already have a solution! :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

will.monge [7:05 AM]
I'm good with the assignments! Thanks Alex!

will.monge [7:10 AM]
Considering what you mention on privacy, the idea is that you will ONLY be able to access the summarizer if you have access to the team. Now if you have access to the team you should be able to access the summarization of *all public channels*, so that we can market this  tool for discovery of the unknown unknowns.

[7:12]
No private channel will be extracted, in order to simplify information privacy. And also because I believe private channels probably don't usually have that amount of activity.

[7:14]
But let me reiterate that this will not be a public tool... Or actually, the tool itself is public, but each team will need to configure on its own to its own slack team for correct data ingestion (should we go as far as really developing a product, beyond the proof of concept)

alex [3:11 PM]
@will.monge: got it! I was thinking more of a web based tool. But if we incorporate the tool directly into Slack, then we alleviate the privacy concern.

[3:12]
Other ethical concern I was thinking about while skimming the privacy policy. Administrators can set the age of how long messages stick around. We probably don't want to have messages in our results that go beyond this timeframe.

will.monge [4:05 PM]
sounds good
